# WeSplitter

## Overview
WeSplitter is my first simple iOS app built with SwiftUI that helps users split a bill among multiple people, including an adjustable tip percentage. The app calculates both the total bill amount and the amount each person needs to pay based on the selected tip and number of people.

## Features
- Users can enter a bill amount.
- Select the number of people to split the bill (2 to 100).
- Choose a tip percentage (0% to 100%).
- Calculates and displays total bill amount including tip and the amount per person after splitting the bill.
- Uses a currency formatter based on the userâ€™s locale.

## Installation
- First clone the repository
- Open the file WeSplitter.xcodeproj in Xcode.
- Then build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the set of flags with more countires.
- Added a timer and scoring system to track answers.
- Improve the UI more with animations
